# PhysicsSimulationBeta

This is a work in progress.

I'm first throwing in some key features this program will need before creating any sort of program architecture.

I want this program to be able to accurately show many laws of physics while allowing users to have full control of variables and objects in run-time.

In the next couple of months I hope to expand this project into something worth creating some documentation/videos for.

Current physics features list:
- 2d Kinematics
- Same object collision
- Window collision
- Friction
